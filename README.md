# YSWS Timer

## Why I Created This

With so many YSWS programs going on together this summer, it was hard to keep track of all of them. I created this timer to help track the deadlines for all of these programs in one place.

The official site ([ysws.hackclub.com](https://ysws.hackclub.com)) is very, very outdated, which made it difficult to stay on top of important dates and deadlines. This tool aims to solve that problem by providing a centralized, up-to-date dashboard for all YSWS program timelines.

## Features

- Track deadlines for multiple Hack Club programs
- Visual countdown timers for upcoming events
